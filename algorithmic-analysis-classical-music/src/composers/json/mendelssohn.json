  "biography": "Jakob Ludwig Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy, known as Felix Mendelssohn, was a German composer, pianist, organist, and conductor of the early Romantic period. Mendelssohn was a musical prodigy, and his work includes symphonies, concerti, oratorios, piano music, and chamber music. His best-known works include the overture and incidental music for 'A Midsummer Night's Dream', the Italian Symphony, the 'Scottish' Symphony, and the 'Hebrides' Overture. His mature music is often seen as a synthesis of musical forms and styles, blending classical models with Romantic expressiveness.",
