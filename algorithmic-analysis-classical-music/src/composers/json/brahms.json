  "biography": "Johannes Brahms was a German composer and pianist of the Romantic period. Born in Hamburg, Brahms spent much of his professional life in Vienna, Austria. His reputation and status as a composer are such that he is sometimes grouped with Johann Sebastian Bach and Ludwig van Beethoven as one of the 'Three Bs' of music, a comment originally made by the nineteenth-century conductor Hans von B\u00fclow.",
