  "biography": "Maurice Ravel was a French composer, pianist, and conductor. He is often associated with impressionism along with his elder contemporary Claude Debussy, although both composers rejected the term. Among his most famous works are 'Boléro', known for its rhythmic drive, and 'Daphnis et Chloé', a ballet. Ravel's music is notable for its rich texture, intricate harmonies, and inventive orchestration."
